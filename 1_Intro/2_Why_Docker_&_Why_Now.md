### How Docker is Changing IT
- Docker released in 2013 as an open source project, by a company called dotCloud, a hosting company
	- dotCloud changed to Docker Inc. about a year later, due to its success
#### Infrastructure Shifts

| 90s               | 00s                         | 10s                 | Now               |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| Mainframe to PC   | Baremetal to Virtualization | Datacenter to Cloud | Host to Container |
| Mac, Windows, DOS | VMWare, HyperV, etc         | AWS, Azure, etc     | Serverless        |
#### Shift to Containers
- Like any shift, migrating is the hardest part
	- Unlike previous shifts, Docker is focused on the migration experience
- Docker is a fast-growing technology
#### Docker
- All about speed
	- Faster deployment especially
- If not using a container, there is a lot to worry about:

- Using containers, everything can be distributed and deployed the same way
- Traditional maintenance and complexity drains budgets, so innovation suffers
	- Can lead to stalled initiatives:
		* Modernizing legacy apps
		* Cloud migration
		* Server consolidation
		* Reducing software time to market
